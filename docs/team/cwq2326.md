### Project: Tracey

Tracey is a desktop app for managing health statuses of NUS Hall Residents. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability archive the database [\#112](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/112) [\#121](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/121)
  * What it does: This allows the user to save a copy of the current working database. The archived file will be saved in a separate directory ordered by date for easy retrieval.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to safely preserve the current working database, which might be valuable to any party of interest or kept for future reference.
  * Highlights: The format of the name of the archived file is design in such a way whereby it is unique to all archived files. In other words, no two archived files have the same name.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to resize the result display window via the command line interface or toggling the button [\#145](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/145) [\#275](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/275)
  * What it does: This allows the user to resize the result display window according to three pre-set size.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to resize the result display window to their preference, and is especially useful if the user's application window size is small or for commands that return long result display text.

* **New Feature**: Added the initial implementation of the pie chart window for the summarise feature [\#81](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/81) [\#85](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/85)
  * What it does: The pie chart window will show an overview of the covid statuses of NUS hall residence from different hall blocks and faculties.
  * Justification: This feature provides the user an easy way to obtain an overview analysis of the covid status of residence residing in his/her hall with just a single command.
  * Highlights: Implemented two methods of obtaining the data needed for the pie chart, one of which is to parse the result display from the summarise feature and the other is using data structures to pass the data. Ultimately went with the latter decision as it is easier to scale up if there is a need to use data for additional attributes.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=cwq2326&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

  * Updated the result display feedback text to indicate which attributes that requires uniqueness already exists in the database [\#261](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/261) [\#295](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/295)
  * Imposed a character limit to the person's name [\#233](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/233)
  * Imposed a character limit to the person's tags [\#238](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/238)
  * Added a badge for each student that will show their covid status which is color coded accordingly [\#33](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/33)
  * Updated parser for commands to check for irrelevant parameters for commands that do not require one such as `list` and `clear` [\#34](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/34)
  * Updated the UI component that contains the buttons to ensure that there are no UI bugs for the buttons when minimising the window to the minimal [\#228](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/228)
